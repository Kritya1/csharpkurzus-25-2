Welcome to Minesweeper, here are the instructions!

Upon starting the program, you'll be able to select a difficulty setting by entering its respective number, or you can also choose to create a custom Minesweeper table by typing in its dimensions and number of mines (less than the product of height and width).
The actual game will begin after that, and you will input your moves as the target tile's coordinates, but with indexing beginning with 0, like in most computer languages.
Before every move, the console will print out wether your next move will attempt to reveal a tile or place a flag; type the character 's' to switch between these two modes.
A game ends immediately after winning or losing, indicated by the smiley face, and you'll be back at the difficulty selection screen. Type the character 'e' in said menu to quit, ending the program.
